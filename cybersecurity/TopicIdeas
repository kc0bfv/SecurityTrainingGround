Password security
	Choose passwords that are more than 8 characters long
	Choose passwords that contain letters and numbers, uppercase and lowercase, and maybe !@#$%^
	Don't choose passwords that are just one or two words, or that are based on your name or birthday
	Consider putting three random words together with a number between them
	Consider thinking up a phrase and making it that phrase, or the first letters of each word in the phrase
	Use different passwords on different sites - what if a hacker steals the passwords for one site?
	If a site isn't important to you, consider using a simple password.  For important sites, use difficult passwords
	Consider using a "password safe" program - a program that remembers all your passwords safely and makes you type one password to get them.  Then you only have to remember one password

Spam/scam/phishing email security


Orient this towards gaming maybe...

Don't download games from weird sites
	Some sites try to trick you with URLs that look ok, but aren't

Use virus scanners/adware scanners/etc?

Don't trust people in chat rooms - they might lie to you
	Be careful about who you send information to, not everyone is nice
	Be careful about who you send photos to, after you send it, they can do whatever they want with it
