		<h1>Malware</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>You can&apos;t securely browse the Internet or check your email if you can&apos;t trust your computer.  Even with a strong password, someone could get around it by installing bad software, called malware, that logs your keystrokes when you type the password in.  Workstation security is easy to achieve if you stick to some basic principles and take care of your system.
		<p>One example of malware is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conficker" target="_blank">Conficker virus</a>, which was first detected in November 2008. The virus used a bug in Windows to spread throughout the Internet.  Most people that were infected didn&apos;t know that a hacker had broken into their computer.  Microsoft had fixed the bug that Conficker used a month before the virus was released, so somebody that installed system patches regularly would not have been infected.  Later, versions of Conficker included the ability to spread by infecting USB Drives and CDs, and by trying guess user passwords.
		<p>You can avoid becoming a Conficker victim by following a few simple guidelines.  Unfortunately, over 1,250,000 Internet addresses are showing signs of being infected with this 6 year old virus.  Apparently a lot of people don&apos;t bother with the basics...

		<h2>Update your Operating System</h2>
		<p>One of the common ways malware uses to infect a computer is to take advantage of old versions of software.  Software makers release new versions of their software that fix bugs, and hackers use those old bugs to break into your computer.  By updating your operating system, malware cannot use those old bugs to break in.  As we saw from the previous example, Conficker spread through a bug that was already fixed!
		<p>How do you update Windows?  Go to the Start Menu, then Control Panel, then find &quot;Windows Update&quot;.  The screenshot below is of Windows 7 Windows Update.  If you click on the &quot;Change Settings&quot; link, you can adjust whether Windows automatically installs updates.

		</div>
		<p>The screenshot shows the automatic update settings for Windows 7.  On most versions of Windows, and really any operating system, you can set the automatic update feature to install updates automatically, check for updates and ask you to install them, or to never check for updates.  The best option is to install updates automatically.  That way your computer will stay up to date with no work from you!

		<h2>Update Other Software</h2>
		<p>Other software can be just as important to update as your operating system, but is often overlooked.  While everything should be updated as often as possible, you may want to pay particular attention to the following:

		<ul>
			<li>Web browsers</li>
			<li>Java</li>
			<li>Browser plugins like Adobe Flash</li>
			<li>Antivirus and Firewall</li>
			<li>Document readers like Microsoft Word, or PDF viewers</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Most users don&apos;t remember to look for updates.  Even if they do, it can be very time-consuming and users won&apos;t get the updates immediately when they&apos;re released.  Having something to manage updates for you can be incredibly helpful.  One update management option for Windows is a free product called <a href="http://secunia.com" target="_blank">Secunia Personal Software Inspector (PSI)</a>.  It may not find and update all the software you&apos;ve got installed, but it can help with a bunch.

		<h2>Use Antivirus Software</h2>
		<p>This one is easy and straight forward.  Have a reputable antivirus installed and keep it up-to-date. Don&apos;t try to be extra secure and install every antivirus; they will most likely interfere with each other.  Only install one.  While antivirus can slow your computer down a little bit, it is worth it.
		<p>Mac and Linux users should also install antivirus.  Besides the fact that more Mac viruses are appearing, it actually helps protect Windows computers too.  Out of 100,000 Mac computers in a study, 20% were carrying at least one Windows virus.  Additionally, 2.7% of the 100,000 computers were actually infected with Mac malware.
		<p>One example of a Mac user without antivirus causing trouble was when a security researcher using a Mac posted a document on his website that was infected with an old piece of malware.  It was downloaded by hundreds of users before he could take it down.  If he had pretty much any antivirus, it would&apos;ve been easily caught.
		<p>If you want to find good antivirus software that won&apos;t slow your computer down, you should check out the reports at <a href="http://www.av-comparatives.org/" target="_blank">AV-Comparatives</a> for reviews of both Mac and Windows antivirus.  Many of the best performing products are free.

		<h2>Scan Files for Viruses</h2>
		<p>Once you&apos;ve got antivirus software installed, you actually need to scan your files occasionally!  Use the software&apos;s settings to tell it to automatically scan your computer at least once a week in the middle of the night, so it doesn&apos;t slow you down when you&apos;re trying to use the computer.  Also, set the software to automatically scan CDs and USB drives when you plug them in.  Scan things that you download from the Internet, or receive in an email, even if those things are from your friends.  Your friends may give you a virus accidentally - most viruses don&apos;t tell you they&apos;re there...
		<p>Removable media such as USB drives, CDs, and DVDs have become common for transferring files.  Unfortunately, they&apos;ve also become a common way for malware to spread.  Let&apos;s view a scenario of how a virus like Conficker would spread via removable media...

		<ol>
			<li>Angela uses her thumb drive at school where it accidentally gets infected</li>
			<li>Angela plugs the thumb drive into her family&apos;s computer that night and infects it</li>
			<li>Later, Angela&apos;s mom, Denise, needs to do some work and plugs her work thumb drive into the family computer - the virus spreads to the work thumb drive</li>
			<li>The next day, Denise plugs her thumb drive into her work computer and the virus infects the work computer</li>
			<li>The virus then also starts to spread across the work network</li>
			<li>Everyone loses because they have malware on their systems</li>
		</ol>

		<p>What does that malware do?  Maybe it just slows down everybody&apos;s computer, or maybe it makes the computers part of an attack on a videogame network, slowing down everyone&apos;s videogames.  In any case, malware is no good.
		<p>If Angela, Denise and Denise&apos;s office installed antivirus software and kept it up to date, they probably would have avoided all these problems.  It also might have helped if they had disabled AutoRun...

		<h3>What the heck is AutoRun?</h3>
		<p>AutoRun is a Windows feature that is turned on by default.  In versions of Windows before Vista it automatically launches a program from a removable media device when it is inserted.  For Windows Vista and later, AutoRun asks the user if it should run software first.  Often that software is good, and it&apos;s exactly what you wanted to run.  Sometimes, though, malware uses AutoRun to trick Windows into running it.
		<p>To disable AutoRun completely you can follow the very complex instructions on <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/967715" target="_blank">Microsoft&apos;s website</a>.  However, it&apos;s a much safer option to skip down that page to the &quot;Fix it for me&quot; section.  Download only the &quot;Disable Autorun Fix It&quot; and run that (the other fix it actually re-enables AutoRun).
