		<h1>Spam Email</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>What is spam?  Maybe right now you think spam is a meat product that comes in a can, and is delicious when fried up with some eggs, but that spam is spelled with a capital &quot;S&quot;.  Spam email is junk email, email that you don&apos;t want but that someone sent to you anyway.  Sometimes spam email is simply trying to sell you something, but other times spam email is trying to steal your information, or money, or break your computer.  Some types of spam are:

		<ul>
			<li>Spam advertisements</li>
			<li>Contest or prize scams</li>
			<li>Phishing</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Why Should You Care?</h2>
		<p>Spam advertisement emails try to trick you into buying products from websites that are not safe to buy items from.  No legitimate, safe, online stores use spam to advertise their products.  That&apos;s because most spam advertising is illegal in the United States.  If you get a spam advertisement for a website, you should not purchase items from the advertised website.  These emails often advertise very good deals for products that you may want to purchase, but the sites that sell them are not good places to buy things.

		<p>Contest or prize scam emails say that they want to give you money, or help you earn money, for little or no work.  This scam takes many forms, but a popular version of these emails is where the email sender pretends to be a Nigerian prince, or a rich businessman in a foreign country.  The email sender says that if you provide your address and bank account number, they will transfer money into your account so they can get it out of their country.  They&apos;ll let you keep a portion of the money, just for helping them.  Many people have been fooled by scammers like this, in 1997 the US Secret Service confirms that US citizens lost about $80 million to contest or prize scams.

		<p>Phishing (pronounced like &quot;fishing&quot;) emails try to trick you into entering your password or account information into a fake webpage.  Phishing emails look like they come from Facebook, or Google, or Amazon, or some other website you use regularly.  The email will give you a link to click on, and the webpage that pops up will look like that website you use regularly.  However, the webpage will not actually be that website.  The phishing email sender just created a site that looks the same as Facebook, or Google, or Amazon.  When you enter your password, or when you enter your address, the phisher will steal that information and use it against you.  Sometimes the website will also tell your computer to download a virus, or other bad software.

		<h2>Protecting Yourself</h2>
		<p>Delete spam email!  Just delete it, that&apos;s the easiest way to protect yourself.  Many email providers, like GMail and Yahoo!, try to delete spam email for you, so you never even have to see it.  Sometimes spam slips through those filters though.  When it does, you have to detect it and delete it yourself.  How can you detect spam email?  Usually spam email is email that:

		<ul>
			<li>Comes from a person or address you don&apos;t know</li>
			<li>Tries to sell you something</li>
			<li>Has weird looking link addresses (URLs)</li>
			<li>Has link URLs that don&apos;t match their text</li>
			<li>Contains weird spelling errors, or text</li>
			<li>Claims you won a contest you didn&apos;t enter</li>
			<li>Asks you to provide personal information</li>
			<li>Has an attachment you didn&apos;t ask for</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Unfortunately, email spammers try their hardest to trick you into clicking on their emails.  Spammers frequently fool people, even when they don&apos;t try very hard.  The tips above are only general tips, that will help, but in general you must be on the lookout for anything out of the ordinary.  Occasionally spam will come from a person that you do know, because the spammer stole their information.  You should never download or click on email attachments that you didn&apos;t request.  If someone, even a friend, sends you an attachment that you didn&apos;t request, you should not open it.  If it was a friend, ask them if they really intended to send that attachment to you.  Many computer viruses spread through email attachment.

		<p>Phishing emails may ask you to go to Facebook or Google by clicking on a link, then entering your account username and password.  When you put your mouse pointer over the email link, your Internet browser will display the real address that clicking the link will take you to.  If that real address doesn&apos;t match the text displayed, the link is a fake.  Sometimes your Internet browser shows a popup with the real address, and sometimes it will display that address in a bar at the bottom of the window.

		<h3>Real and Fake Link Examples</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Real link: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a></li>
			<li>Fake link: <a href="http://www.facebook.asdf.com">Facebook</a></li>
		</ul>

		<p>If you hover your mouse over that first link, &quot;http://www.facebook.com/&quot; shows up, and that&apos;s the real address for Facebook.  If you hover your mouse over the second link, the address says &quot;facebook&quot;, but it also has a piece to the link that is not part of Facebook&apos;s address.  A scammer created this fake Internet address, but made it look real.

		<p>The safest way to get to a website is to open a new Internet browser window, and type in the address that you already know for that website.

		<ul>
			<li>Real link: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/accounts/">http://www.amazon.com/accounts/</a></li>
			<li>Fake link: <a href="http://www.amaz0n.cn/accounts/">http://www.amazon.com/accounts/</a></li>
		</ul>

		<p>Again, hover your mouse over the fake and real links.  Do you see how the fake link lies to you?  Before you hover your mouse over it, the link looks like it&apos;s for Amazon&apos;s real website, but hovering your mouse tells you that the link actually goes to a version of the address that&apos;s in China (.cn) and that has a zero instead of an &quot;o&quot;.

		<p>The safest way to get to a website is to open a new Internet browser window, and type in the address that you already know for that website.
