		<h1>Password Security</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Many Internet-based services use passwords to protect you online.  For example:

		<ul>
			<li>Facebook uses passwords to prevent someone from impersonating you</li>
			<li>Dropbox uses passwords to protect data that you want to keep private</li>
			<li>Amazon uses passwords to prevent other people from buying things using your credit card</li>
			<li>Banks use passwords to prevent people from spending your money</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Other uses for passwords exist, and most services do some combination of these things.  Passwords are often the only thing services use to protect you and your data, and therefore they are critical to your security online.

		<h2>Hackers and Passwords</h2>
		<p>Passwords have been in the news a lot, recently.  Hackers break into companies and steal passwords, hackers guess passwords, hackers trade passwords online...  How do hackers do all that?

		<p>If a hacker breaks into a company&apos;s computer systems, he or she can download the file containing all the passwords.  That might look like this:

		<table>
			<tr class="defListHead"><td>User</td><td>Password</td></tr>
			<tr><td>mike</td><td>mike123</td></tr>
			<tr><td>chris2014</td><td>chrisIsTheBest!</td></tr>
			<tr><td>jimbo</td><td>asdfJimbo</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Jane</td><td>jn$5!as334n0</td></tr>
		</table>

		<p>Now the hacker has all the usernames and passwords, so they can easily login as any of those users!  That&apos;s terrible.  Responsible companies store their passwords using a secure method called &quot;hashing&quot;.  &quot;Hashed&quot; passwords look like gobbeldygook to a hacker, something like this:

		<table>
			<tr class="defListHead"><td>User</td><td>Hashed Password</td></tr>
			<tr><td>mike</td><td>c9d7bf3e1dee4e0a0bd243c86b053b8b</td></tr>
			<tr><td>chris2014</td><td>1ecd5271b8aec27669d0abda0c88186c</td></tr>
			<tr><td>jimbo</td><td>43f6589407a536b204111b723de5af1c</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Jane</td><td>b7e478636917a243cc8092824a3e3638</td></tr>
		</table>

		<p>Just let that jerk hacker try to use those!  He or she cannot simply login to the company, now, first they have to &quot;crack&quot; the passwords.  &quot;Cracking&quot; difficult passwords takes a long time, and involves a computer trying passwords over-and-over-and-over-and-over-an... well, you get the point.

		<p>Actually, the hacker will crack mike and jimbo&apos;s passwords very easily.  Cracking chris2014&apos;s password will take much longer, and the hacker will probably never figure out Jane&apos;s password.  Jane picked a great password, how can you pick passwords like Jane&apos;s?

		<h2>Protecting Yourself</h2>
		<p>Here are some tips:

		<h3>Password Do&apos;s</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Choose passwords longer than 8 characters</li>
			<li>Choose passwords with upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and funky characters (like $, % or #)</li>
			<li>Consider putting 4 or more words together in a phrase that you will remember</li>
			<li>Use different passwords for different sites, especially sites with your important data</li>
			<li>Use a password safe program like 1Password or KeePass to store many difficult passwords, and only have to remember one password</li>
		</ul>

		</div>

		<h3>Password Dont&apos;s</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Don&apos;t choose passwords that contain your user name, or real name, or birthday</li>
			<li>Don&apos;t choose one or two words as your password (&quot;timeMachine&quot; and &quot;bookLover&quot; are no good)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>When hackers crack passwords they tell their computer to guess with all the passwords in the dictionary, then they tell the computer to guess two-word combinations, and combinations with a few numbers thrown in there.  These techniques only take a little while to try, even when the list of all the users is very large.  Hackers start with those techniques because so many people choose passwords like that.  In less than an hour, a hacker would have mike and jimbo&apos;s private data, and perhaps they wouldn&apos;t go any further than that.

		<p>By choosing a password that&apos;s fits those &quot;do&apos;s&quot; up above, you make it more difficult for a hacker to crack your password.  If the hacker can get mike and jimbo&apos;s password quickly, they&apos;ll probably give up before they get your password.  Try it out in the box below!  When you type an example password in below, your computer calculates about how long it will take a hacker to crack your password.  The box doesn&apos;t figure out if anything you type in is a dictionary word, or is based on a dictionary word.  It assumes that a hacker can guess 1 million passwords per second, which is a reasonable assumption

		<div id="passwordArea">
			<input type="text" id="passwordEntryBox" oninput="javascript:calc('passwordEntryBox', 'outputArea');">
			<label id="outputArea" for="passwordEntryBox">0 seconds</label>
		</div>

		<p>Again - don&apos;t enter dictionary words.  Don&apos;t enter your real password, either.

		</div>

		<p>Finally - you should avoid reusing your passwords.  If you use a password on one website, don&apos;t use it on other websites.  This is especially true if you care about the data stored on those websites...  If a hacker breaks into one website and gets your password, they can use that password on the other sites.  Don&apos;t make it easy for hackers!

		<p>Unfortunately, it&apos;s tough to remember one good password, let alone one for each website.  Fortunately, there are several password storage programs out there, like <a href="http://agilebits.com/1password" target="_blank">1Password</a>, <a href="http://keepass.info" target="_blank">KeePass</a>, and <a href="https://lastpass.com/" target="_blank">LastPass</a>.  These are called &quot;Password Safes&quot;, or &quot;Password Vaults&quot;, or &quot;Password Managers&quot;.  If you&apos;re interested in using one, you should choose one based on the devices it supports, and the devices you use.  For example, KeePass has versions that work on Android, iPhone, Windows, Mac, and Linux.  Also, it&apos;s open-source, so anyone can look at the source code and make sure it keeps your passwords secure instead of emailing them to a nefarious hacker...

		<h2>Windows Password Settings</h2>
		<p>There are a few simple things you can do to make Windows more secure by default.  The Windows security policies provide a way to require password security for all users.  Go into the Control Panel, open Administrative Tools, then Local Security Policy.  Some good settings in the Password Policy section are:

		<ul>
			<li>Enforce Password History: 5</li>
			<li>Maximum Password Age: 90</li>
			<li>Minimum Password Length: 8</li>
			<li>Password Must Meet Complexity Requirements: Enabled</li>
			<li>Store Password Using Reversible Decryption: Disabled</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Additionally, some good settings for the Account Lockout Policy section are:
		<ul>
			<li>Account Lockout Duration: 5</li>
			<li>Account Lockout Threshold: 5</li>
			<li>Reset Account Lockout Counter After: 5</li>
		</ul>
